# Flappy-Penguin
I went onine and saw the game flapppy bird and thaught that I could create that in python so i gave it a try, it is a short program which I made using python and I used pyinstaller to turn it into a .exe file

When you install the .exe file on windows make sure that when you run it to click the show more option when it asks you about if you trust the author of the file and then click run anyway

You can get the file with this link located in my drive:
